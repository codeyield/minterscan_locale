    <b>KARMA</b> from validators is a sign of the quality of the project.
    The presence of karma shows support from validators based on their voting power.
    To implement the karming mechanism, all validators received karma from the Minter team.

    The transfer of karma from the validator to the coin is carried out
    by the validator by sending the transaction:
    <ul>
      <li>Transaction must be sent from the validator's rewards address</li>
      <li>Amount must be at least 0.01 KARMA</li>
      <li>
        Comment should contain the text <b>Karma $ticker</b>, for example,
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="/tx/Mtfcda1bc65d9d0bb53612cebd21375ac4e22f0143a2281b3bedfe263b6af69a85">
          Karma MSCAN
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>Transaction must be sent to the coin creator's wallet</li>
    </ul>

    ☯️ <b>Zen</b> validator provide karma for projects that meet the following rules:
    <ul>
      <li>The project is related to the Minter ecosystem</li>
      <li>
        The project should be unique, not a copy of an existing project.
      </li>
      <li>
        The project benefits the Minter ecosystem,
        has a huge audience and solves an actual problem
      </li>
      <li>
        A project is a service, bot, application or site.
        Service at the idea stage, just a separately issued coin and so on  does not fit this definition.
      </li>
    </ul>
